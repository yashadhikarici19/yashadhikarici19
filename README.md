Hey everyone. I'm starting this discussion thread to introduce myself.

I'm Yash Adhikari , pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Information Technology from Acropolis Institute Of Technology and Research, Indore(M.P.). I taught myself JavaScript and React.js and came towards web development only because of the quality resources made available by the open source community .
It is my turn to help the open source community. I want to start my open source journey with this wonderful project rwso.
I'm inclined to learn new technologies and have good experience in web development with React.js.
Eagerly waiting to learn as well as help the open source community.
